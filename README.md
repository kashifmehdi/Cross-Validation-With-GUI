## General Info ‚ÑπÔ∏è
The "Cross Validation with GUI" project aims to develop a user-friendly graphical interface for conducting cross-validation, a fundamental technique in machine learning model evaluation. Cross-validation is crucial for assessing a model's performance and generalizability by partitioning the dataset into multiple subsets and iteratively training and testing the model.

## Technologies Used üíª
This project is created using:
- **Python** (`Python`) : Any version above 3.8
- **numpy** (`numpy`): For numerical operations and array manipulations.
- **pandas** (`pandas`): For data manipulation and analysis using DataFrame structures.
- **matplotlib** (`matplotlib`): For data visualization, including plotting graphs and charts.
- **scikit-learn** (`sklearn`): For machine learning algorithms and tools.
  - `datasets`: Provides built-in datasets for experimentation.
  - `model_selection`: Includes functions for model selection and evaluation, such as cross-validation.
  - `neighbors` (`KNeighborsClassifier`): Implements the k-nearest neighbors classification algorithm.
  - `mixture` (`GaussianMixture`): Implements Gaussian Mixture Models for clustering.
  - `preprocessing` (`StandardScaler`): Provides tools for data preprocessing, such as standardization.
  - `svm` (`SVC`): Implements Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms for classification.
  - `metrics` (`confusion_matrix`): Includes evaluation metrics like confusion matrix.
- **seaborn** (`seaborn`): Enhances the visualization of statistical data using Matplotlib.
- **tkinter** (`tkinter`): Provides GUI functionality for Python applications.
  - `filedialog`: Allows opening file dialogs to interact with files and directories.
  - `ttk`: Provides themed widgets for GUI development.
- **matplotlib.backends.backend_tkagg** (`FigureCanvasTkAgg`): Enables embedding Matplotlib figures into Tkinter applications.


## Features ‚ú®
* Supports various cross-validation methods including K-Nearest Neighbours, Gaussian Mixture Model,Support Vector Classification.
* Graphical User Interface (GUI) for interactive model evaluation and comparison.
* Choose from three different datasets directly through the GUI for seamless validation. (Iris, Wine, Breast)
* Visualize model performance metrics for each fold or iteration.

## Setup üõ†Ô∏è
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Install tkinter using pip:
```bash
$ pip install tkinter
```
2. Install Numpy:
```bash
$ pip install numpy
```
3. Install Pandas:
```bash
$ pip install pandas
```
4. Install scikit:
```bash
$ pip install scikit-learn
```
5. Install matplitlib:
```bash
$ pip install matplotlib
```
## Usage ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
Once the project is set up, you can run the main script to start the Cross-Validation GUI application. Use the interface to load your dataset, choose machine learning models, and select cross-validation settings. The GUI will guide you through the process of training and evaluating your models.üòä
